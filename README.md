## 🧠 About Me

I’m a highly motivated learner in the field of cybersecurity, working to build a strong foundation in both blue teaming and ethical hacking.  
While I started through academic routes, I’ve chosen to focus on **practical certifications, hands-on labs**, and **real-world projects** to prove my skills and grow fast in the industry.

My goal is to land a junior role in cybersecurity, gain experience, build strong connections, and eventually turn my passion into full-time specialized work in **threat hunting, malware analysis**, or **red teaming**.
